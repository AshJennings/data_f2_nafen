Scripts for making dataset 2:

- Add ICTA width to files from dataset1.
  ICTA width is smoothed (different window for different files),
  peaks are removed. Plots with original/smoothed values are
  created for manual check.

- Remove points where temperature was not stable

Data will go to ../data2_1m and ../data2_5m folders

Access to ../data1 dataset
should be available.
f2/icta data is taken from the database at http://slazav.xyz:8091/
